# 2022 Winter Break Friend Survey Results
*Fun Exploratory Findings From A Survey Amongst Friends. An independent, self-guided project conducted in December of 2022*

Based on the results of a quick survey amongst friends, I have cleaned the results into a readable dataframe that can be used for further data analysis. Using this cleaned up data set, I have conducted exploratory data analysis by presenting the results through easy to interpret visualizations revealing the most insightful information based on the data that was collected.

After reviewing the results of the survey in the data set, supervised machine learning was conducted through a Decision Tree Classification Model. K-fold Cross Validation was used through systematic feature selection and model hyperparameter selection in order to create the classification model. Because this model was created on a data set with high sample bias and a very low number of observations, the model was found to perform very poorly on the test set, which was to be expected. The model was more so carried out to understand whether the data set could have shown any correlations between the group of mutual friends whom the data set was created out of, but the group displayed little insightful findings.

**WARNING:** This survey analysis was conducted between close friends with ages ranging from 19-21. That being said, in order to avoid polluting the data with any bias, the uncensored answers given in the survey were left in the survey results. Thus, there is some use of foul language in the following results.
